This module contains multiple security related features: 
1. updating recovery image secure boot info into SECCFG partition.
2. verify secure file list & secure files.
3. libsecdl.so: provide utilities for secure image parsing and image authentication.

WHAT IT DOES?
=============
sbchk is a service declared in init.rc and intialized by init process.
Its two functions would be
1. verify secure file list and secure files.
   secure file list will be put at system/etc/firmware/S_ANDRO_SFL.ini. This file
   will be verified first. After that, the content of secure file list will be trusted.
   The files recorded in secure file list will be verified.
   note: In L, sbchk cannot be put into bootimage ramdisk due to SELinux neverallow rules.
   It's put in system/bin folder and is not verified first, thus the reduced security level.
2. update secure boot info into SECCFG
   recovery image will be written to recovery partition after successful boot, SECCFG partition
   will be updated for secure boot.

libsecdl.so is a shared library which provides service for secure image parsing/image authentication 
with assumption that image is already loaded into DRAM.
1. get public key buffer in preloader GFH.
2. get real image offset and image size in secure image.
3. image authentication.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
Most of the files are in binary release format.
Some are in platform independent folder and some are in platform dependent folder.
Platform independent part: vendor/mediatek/proprietary/external/seclib.
Platform dependent part: vendor/mediatek/proprietary/platform/mtxxxx/seclib.
